# Examination System

The **Examination System** is designed to allow the management of exams, including exam terms, results, and statistics. It allows students to enroll in exam terms, view their results, and interact with the system through a web application, while teachers can create and manage exam terms and results through the same web application. Managers gain insights into statistics, which are aggregated and analyzed to evaluate academic performance. The system is composed of these modules:

- **Exam Terms Manager**: Handles the creation, scheduling, and management of exam terms.
- **Result Manager**: Manages exam results and course credits.
- **Exam Statistics Manager**: Displays statistics based on exam results and student performance.
- **Result Aggregator** CLI application: Aggregates historical exam results into statistical data.

These components interact with external systems for authentication, notifications, and scheduling.
